    <h2>What’s The Difference Between High And Low Fantasy?</h2>
    <p>Any novel that includes a level of the unbelievable (be it magic or monsters) is described as fantasy.
        The difference between high fantasy stories and low fantasy is simply the setting. Whereby all fantasy fiction includes characters who are doing unbelievable things (from talking to goblins and flying, to fighting dragons and performing magic) – only high fantasy is set in a make-believe world.
        Low fantasy, on the other hand, takes place in a real-world setting – although that doesn’t mean it has to be any less fantastical! 
        Let’s take a look at each in more detail, starting with high fantasy novels.
